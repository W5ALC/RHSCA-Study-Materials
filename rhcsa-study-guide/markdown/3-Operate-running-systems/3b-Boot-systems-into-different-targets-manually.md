## Runlevels and Systemd Targets RHEL 8

**üìù NOTE:** *The comparison of SysV runlevels is mainly for reference.*

### Older SysV runlevels

"Runlevels" are an obsolete way to start and stop groups of services used in SysV init. Systemd provides a compatibility layer that maps runlevels to targets, and associated binaries like runlevel.

`rc0.d/ rc1.d/ rc2.d/ rc3.d/ rc4.d/ rc5.d/ rc6.d/ rc.d/`
