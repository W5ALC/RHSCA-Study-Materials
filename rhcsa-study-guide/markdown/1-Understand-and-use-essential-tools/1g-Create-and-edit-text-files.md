===

## Editing files

You should be familiar with at least one of the editors below:
- vi (1p)              - screen-oriented (visual) display editor
- vim (1)              - Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor
- nano (1)             - Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone
- emacs                - GNU Emacs text editor

**üìù NOTE:** _Be aware that `vim` changes files by copying the file over (so the inode also changes)._
