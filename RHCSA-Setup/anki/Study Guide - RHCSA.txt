What does RAID provide?	Data redundancy, performance improvements, or both.
What are the general characteristics of RAID 0?	<div>- Splits data evenly across stripe sets/striped volumes on 2 or more disks.</div><div>- No parity information is stored.</div><div>- There is no redundancy.</div><div>- There is no fault tolerance.</div><div>- Failure of one drive will cause the entire array to fail.</div><div>- RAID 0 is used to increase speed performance.</div>
What is striping in RAID 0?	<div>- Striping spreads data across 2 or more physical drives.</div><div>- The data is divided into blocks, and those blocks are spread across stripe sets/striped volumes on 2 or more disks.</div><div>- The disks can be hard drives, SSDs, etc.</div><div>- Multiple stripes increase read/write throughput, leading to better read/write performance.</div><div>- No fault tolerance or redundancy makes striping best suited for non-critical data sets.</div>
Discuss RAID parity information.	<div>- Uses a parity bit or check bit.</div><div>- Parity bits are the simplest form of error detecting code.</div><div>- A bit is added to a string of binary code to ensure that the total number of 1-bits in the string is even or odd.</div><div>- There are 2 variants of parity bits:</div><div>1.) even parity bits.</div><div>2.) odd parity bits.</div><div>- Error detection: If the number of bits, including the parity bit, are transmitted incorrectly, this means that the parity bit will be incorrect, indicating a parity error in the transmission.</div>
Discuss RAID 0 redundancy.	<div>- RAID 0 has no redundancy.</div><div>- The failure of one disk in the array will cause the entire array to fail.</div><div>- Since data is striped across multiple disks, the failure of one disk will cause total data loss.</div><div>- Due to its lack of redundancy, RAID 0 is not appropriate for mission-critical data storage.</div>
Discuss RAID 0 fault tolerance.	<div>- Fault tolerance allows a system to continue operating, even in the event of a failure or fault in one or more of its components.</div><div>- RAID 0 has no fault tolerance.</div><div>- A single fault (the failure of one disk) will cause a RAID 0 to fail (complete loss of data).</div>
Discuss RAID 0 performance.	<div>- RAID 0 provides very good read/write performance.</div><div>- For example, a RAID 0 array with n number of drives can theoretically provide n times the read/write performance (speed) of a single drive.</div><div>- RAID 0 is used in applications that require high performance, but that can accept lower reliability (e.g. scientific computing and computer gaming).</div>
In Linux/Unix, what is the purpose of the RAM disk?	In Linux/Unix, the RAM disk is a memory-based file system that provides very &nbsp;fast low-latency file access.
