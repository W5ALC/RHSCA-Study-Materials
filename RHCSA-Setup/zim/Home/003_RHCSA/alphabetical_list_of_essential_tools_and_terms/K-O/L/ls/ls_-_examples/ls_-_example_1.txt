ls:ls - examples
[[L]]

One common use of the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls command is to display the [[P-T:S:SELinux]] context (attributes) of a file or folder.  This is invoked by adding the -l and -Z options to ls. 
* The -l option tells ls to use a long listing format.
* The -Z option tells ls to print the security (SELinux) context of each file listing one file per line.  The --context option is the equivalent of -Z

So let us assume that we have a file named sed.html. To see its SELinux security context, we would run one of the following commands:
* ls -lZ sed.html
* ls -l --context sed.html

The results on my system are shown below:

Interestingly enough, the [[P-T:S:stat]] command can also be used to show SELinux context information, but it also shows other attributes such as Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:F-J:I:inode number, block number etc. Here is the output of stat sed.html:
