**Summary**
Multiboot is a specification for a Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:B:Boot Loader that can handle booting a computer system that contains many computer operating systems. The ultimate goal is to get away from every computer operating system installed on a computer having its own Boot Loader. Instead, booting into any one of the multiple operating systems on that particular computer will be handled by a single Boot Loader.  In Linux, the most popular Multiboot-enabled Boot Loader is Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:F-J:G:GRUB.
