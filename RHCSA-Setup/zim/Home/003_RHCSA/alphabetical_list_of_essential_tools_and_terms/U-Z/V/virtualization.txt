**RHCSA Objective: **005e Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems as virtual guests

**Summary:**
**virtualization** is a technology used to create virtual computers that run in virtualization software using some of the hardware resources of a physical computer system.  For example, a physical computer could run one virtual computer system running the CentOS operating sytem, and another virtual computer system running the FreeBSD operating system.  Both systems could be independently alloted a portion of the physical hardware resources of the host physical computer.
