:Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:D:df:df - examples:df - examples

**Summary**
In df - example 1, we will display the size of our mounted filesystems in units of 1K-blocks (the default), and in 1GB-blocks using the :Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:D:df:df - examples:df command.
* We will use the df command with no options to display sizes in [[+1K-blocks]].
* We will use the df -BG command to display sizes in [[+1G-blocks]]. df -BG tells df to use a blocksize unit of 1 GB (1 Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:D:df:df - examples:F-J:G:GiB of storage capacity).

By default, the :Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:D:df:df - examples:df command displays filesystem size information in units of 1K-blocks.
* Each 1K-block = 1024 bytes.
* 1 GB = 1 GiB of storage capacity.
* 1 Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:D:df:df - examples:F-J:G:GiB equals 2^30 bytes which equals 1,073,741,824 bytes.

So here is the conversion:
1K-block/1024 bytes x 1,073,741,824 bytes/GB = __1,048,576 1K-blocks/1 GB__

So let us assume that I issues the following command at a terminal prompt:
* df
* df returns the size of his [[/home]] filesystem as 431,378,504 1K-blocks
* So the file system size in GB is calculated as follows:
	* 431,378,504 1K-blocks x 1 GB /(1,048,576 1K-blocks) = __411.394599915 GB__
	* **NOTE: **when using the df -BG option, df always rounds up to the nearest whole number. So it would report 411.394599915 GB as 412 GB.

Finally, let's look at the terminal output running df and df -BG respectively.
