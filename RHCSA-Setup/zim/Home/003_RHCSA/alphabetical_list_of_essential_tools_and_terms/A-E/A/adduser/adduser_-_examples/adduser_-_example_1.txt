**Summary**
In adduser - example 1, we will add a new user called test_user to our CentOS virtual machine. We will also use the passwd command to create a password for test_user: this_is_not_a_strong_password_12345

Tasks:
* Creating the test_user account.
	* We will first login to the Centos system:

{{./pasted_image.png}}
* Next, we'll create the test_user account:
	* We'll first try to do it with this command: __adduser test_user__. This should fail because we should need administrative privileges to create a new user account:

{{./pasted_image001.png}}
	* As expected, it failed. The correct command is this: __su -c "adduser test_user"__
	* We will run the correct command, and we will use this command to verify that test_user was created: __cat /etc/passwd | grep test_user__
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
	* Now, we will set a password for test_user: this_is_not_a_strong_password_12345
	* Again, we will first try to do it without admin privileges, expecting it to fail:

{{./pasted_image003.png}}
	* It did. We are starting to build an intuitive sense of what kinds of things require admin privileges, and what kinds of things do not.
	* We know how the command should be properly constructed: __su -c "passwd test_user"__

{{./pasted_image004.png}}
	* Success! Now, the final test will be to logout, and then login as test_user:

{{./pasted_image005.png}}
	* Success!
	* We will continue working with the test_user account. In a future example, we'll change test_user's password to something more secure, and we'll start learning how to deal with user accounts.
