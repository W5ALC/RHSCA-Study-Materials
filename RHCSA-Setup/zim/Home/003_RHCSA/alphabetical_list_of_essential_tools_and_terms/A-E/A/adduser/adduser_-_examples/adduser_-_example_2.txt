**KYWRD:** adduser - example 2
**RHCSA Objective: **006a Create, delete, and modify local user accounts

**Summary**
Add a new normal user, Jean-Luc Picard, to a CentOS system, and verify that his account was created properly.

**adduser - example 2 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
1. Startup your CentOS/RHEL system, and log in as a normal user.
2. Using the adduser command, create a new user for Jean-Luc Picard, username: jean-luc.picard:
	a. __su -c "adduser -m jean-luc.picard"__
	b. The -m flag tells adduser to create a home directory for Jean-Luc.
3. Verify that Jean-Luc's account has been correctly created:
	a. Verify that the folder **jean-luc.picard** is present:  __ls /home__
	b. View the details of Jean-Luc's account: __id jean-luc.picard__
4. We still have not set a password for Jean Luc, so we will set his password to be: **this_is_a_horrible_password_12345**
	a. __su -c "passwd jean-luc.picard"__
5. After all of that work, we do not want to keep a user account on our system where the whole world knows the password, so we are going to delete Jean-Luc's account using the userdel command:
	a. __su -c "userdel -r jean-luc.picard"__
	b. The -c option tells userdel to delete Jean-Luc's home directory and mail spool (if it exists).
6. Verify that Jean Luc's home folder is gone: __ls /home__
7. Verify that the id command yields no results for Jean-Luc: __id jean-luc.picard__
	a. **RESULT:** id: jean-luc.picard: no such user
