**KYWRD:** alias - example 2
**RHCSA Objective: **001a Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax

**Summary**
Use alias to create a permanent alias to a very long command.

**Scenario**
Brent has an extremely long command that he is tired of typing in its entirety. He wants to create a short alias so that he does not have to type so much. 
* The full command: __curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RexDjere/RHCSA/master/examples/001b/001b%20-%20example%203/00_tech_companies_unsorted.txt > 00_tech_companies_unsorted.txt__
* Brent wants to replace this with a much shorter command: get_unsorted.
* He wants to make the alias permanent.
* How is Brent going to do it?

**alias - example 3 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
1. Startup your CentOS/RHEL system, and login as a normal user.
2. We are going to add a permanent alias to our .bashrc file so that we can use the alias forever.
	a. Open .bashrc in vi: __vi ~/.bashrc__
	b. Type the letter i to shift to insert mode. It should now say "INSERT" at the bottom of the vi window.
	c. use to down arrow key to go down to the end of the file, just below "# User specific aliases and functions".
	d. To get to the line below "# User specific aliases and functions", you will have to use the right arrow key to get to the end of that line, and then hit "Enter".
	e. You should now be on the line right below "# User specific aliases and functions".
	f. Enter this command: 
		1. __alias get_unsorted="curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RexDjere/RHCSA/master/examples/001b/001b%20-%20example%203/00_tech_companies_unsorted.txt > 00_tech_companies_unsorted.txt"__
	g. Save .bashrc:
		1. Hit "ESC". The "INSERT" at the bottom left of the vi window should go away.
		2. Type a colon followed by w and q: __:wq__
		3. Hit "ENTER".
		4. .bashrc is now saved.
	h. Test the alias:
		1. Log out and log back in to load the new [[/bashrc]] file:
			a. __exit__
			b. You'll now see a login prompt. Log in as a normal user.
		2. Run the alias **(Figure 1)**: __get_unsorted__
		3. Verify that 00_tech_companies_unsorted.txt was created properly **(Figure 2)**: __cat 00_tech_companies_unsorted.txt__
