**Summary**
A block is a series of data of fixed length (e.g. 4kB, 8kB etc.). The **block size** of a filesystem in Linux can be found using the blockdev command. 
For examples:
* __blockdev --getbsz /dev/sda1__ (this command must be run with root privileges => su -c "blockdev --getbsz [[/dev/sda1"]])
