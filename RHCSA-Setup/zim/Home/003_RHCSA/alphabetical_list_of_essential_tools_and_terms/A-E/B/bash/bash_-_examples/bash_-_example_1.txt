**KYWRD:** bash - example 1
**RHCSA Objective: **001a Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax

**Summary:**
Manipulate numerical variables in bash.

**Scenario:**
Ban Ki-moon is the Director of RHEL sysadmins at the United Nations. He wants to brush up on his Bash skills. He performs an interesting thought experiment:
- There are 34 officers onboard the UNS (United Nations Ship) Endeavor: **num_officers**
- There are 163 enlisted sailors onboard the UNS Endeavor: **num_enlisted**
- What is total number of crew members? Variable: **total_crew**
- What is the ratio of officers-to-enlisted?

How can Ban express all of this within Bash?

**bash - example 1 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
1. Startup your CentOS/RHEL system, and login as a normal user.
2. define the variable **num_officers**: __num_officers=34__
3. define the variable **num_enlisted**: __num_enlisted=163__
4. define the variable **total_crew**: __((total_crew=num_officers+num_enlisted))__
5. Show the value of **total_crew**: __echo $total_crew__
6. Show the ratio of officers-to-enlisted: __awk "BEGIN {print $num_officers/$num_enlisted}"__
