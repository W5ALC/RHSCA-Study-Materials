**KYWRD:** fuser - example 1
**RHCSA Objective: **004a Create, mount, unmount, and use vfat, ext4, and xfs file systems

**Summary**
Display which processes/users are currently using a mounted partition. 

**The scenario:** 
* We tried to unmount the [[/mnt]] partition using the unmount command, but we received an error message saying that the partition is in use. 
* We want to see which users/processes are using the [[/mnt]] partition. 
* **NOTE: on the CentOS system in this example, the /mnt partition was not actually mounted.**

**fuser - example 1 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
1. Startup your CentOS/RHEL system, and login as a normal user.
2. View which users/processesare using the [[/mnt]] partition: 
	a. __fuser -mu /mnt__
		1. The -m option tells fuser to use the name that we give it as the mount point to check (e.g. [[/mnt]])
		2. The -u option tells fuser to give us the username, in addition to the process id (PID), of the user who is using the mounted resource.
