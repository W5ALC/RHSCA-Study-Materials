**Summary**
false - example 1 shows that the exit code for the false command is in fact 1 (failure), and that the exit code for the true command is in fact 0 (success). To show the exit code of the false command, we will use this echo command: __echo $?__ 
$? is a special variable that stores the exit code of the most recently run command.
