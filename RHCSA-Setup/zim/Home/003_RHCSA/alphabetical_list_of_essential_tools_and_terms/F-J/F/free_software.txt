**Summary**
Free software is software that guarantees the software's user four basic freedoms:
* The freedom to study the software's source code.
* The freedom to modify the software's source code in anyway that he or she sees fit.
* The freedom to share their modifications with anyone who wants or needs to use them.
* The freedom to re-distribute the software, and its source code, in a way that guarantees that the recipient will retain all four freedoms.
