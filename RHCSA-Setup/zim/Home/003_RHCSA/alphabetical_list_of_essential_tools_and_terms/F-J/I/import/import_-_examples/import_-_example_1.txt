**KYWRD:** import - example 1
**RHCSA Objective: **001a Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax

**Summary**
Open a terminal, type some commands, take a screenshot of the session, and save the screenshot as **session_09032018.png**.

**Scenario**
Antonio is a RHEL sysadmin at CNN. He wants to take a screenshot of his terminal session, but he realizes that RHEL 7 does not have the **import** utility in its repositories. Luckily, he also has a Fedora system at work which does have the **import** utility. Antonio wants to open a terminal, rename the terminal **Terminal_Session_09032018**,  type a short set of commands, take a screenshot, and save the screenshot as **session_09032018.png**. He will save the folder in a folder in his home directory named **sessions**. 
a.) What command will Antonio use to rename his terminal **Terminal_Session_09032018**?
b.) What command will Antonio use to create the **sessions** directory?
c.) What command will Antonio use to create a folder inside sessions named **text_files**?
d.) What command will Antonio use to create 10 files inside **text_files**: **text_file001.txt** to **text_file010.txt**?
e.) What command will he use to take a screenshot of his screens, and save it in **sessions **as **session_09032018.png**?
f.) What command will he use to remove all of the files and folders that he created once he is done?

**import - example 1 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
Open a **gnome-terminal**.
a.) Previously, Antonio would have opened a new terminal window named Terminal_Session_09032018 with this command:
	1.) __gnome-terminal --title="Terminal_Session_09032018"__
	2.) Unfortunately, the --title option has been removed from gnome-terminal.
	3.) So now, Antonio has to change the title manually using gnome-terminal's GUI interface:
		a. Select the Terminal menu option. You'll get a dropdown menu.
		b. Select **Set Title...**
		c. Enter the new terminal name, and hit **OK**.
	4.) See **Figure 1** below.
b.) __mkdir sessions__
c.) __mkdir sessions/text_files__
d.) __touch sessions/text_files/text_file{001..010}.txt__
e.) __import -window Terminal_Session_09032018 sessions/session_09032018.png__
See **Figures 2 and 3** below.
f.) __rm -r sessions__
See **Figure 4** below.
