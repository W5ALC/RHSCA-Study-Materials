**KYWRD:** GRUB
**RHCSA Objective: **005k Modify the system bootloader

**GRUB image files:**
* boot.img:
	* the first part of GRUB to start.
	* is contained in the Master Boot Record.
	* since boot sector is 512 bytes, boot.img is 512 bytes as well => designed to fit in the boot sector.
	* boot.img has a simple function: to read the first sector of the core image and jump to it (the first sector of the core image contains diskboot.img).
* diskboot.img:
	* is contained in the first sector of the core image.
	* does not have file handling, so the location of core.img is hard coded into it.
	* reads remainder of core image into memory and loads the operating system kernel.
* cdboot.img:
	* performs the same functions as diskboot image if booting from a CD-ROM.
	* acts as first sector of core image when booting from CD-ROM.
* pxeboot.img:
	* acts as stage of core image when booting from network using PXE boot.
* lnxboot.img:
	* image that looks very similar to Linux kernel.
	* when placed at start of core image, allows booting via LILO.
* kernel.img:
	* contains GRUB's basic run-time facilities. Is rarely used.
* core.img:
	* is the core image of GRUB.
	* is built dynamically from the kernel image and kernel modules.
	* is designed to be kept small.
