This MBR is located withing the first 512 bytes of the boot medium (typically the computers main hard drive). Once GRUB's first stage is loaded, it loads stage 1.5.

GRUB Stage 1 is associated with the file Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:B:boot.img located in the Master Boot Record ([[K-O:M:MBR]]) of the boot hard disk.  The MBR is contained in Sector 0 of the boot hard disk.
