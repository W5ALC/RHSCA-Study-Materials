**Summary**
GRUB's Stage 1.5 Boot Loader is loaded into memory by [[GRUB Stages:GRUB Stage 1|GRUB's Stage 1 Boot Loader]]. GRUB Stage 1.5 is associated with the core.img file, and is contained in Sectors 1 through 62 of the boot hard disk. GRUB Stage 1.5 also contains file system drivers so that it can read the file system information that it needs to initialize [[GRUB Stage 2]].
