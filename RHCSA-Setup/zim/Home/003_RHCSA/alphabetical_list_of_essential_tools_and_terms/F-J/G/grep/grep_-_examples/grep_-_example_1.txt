**Summary:**
Search an unsorted list to find all of the CEO's who assumed their positions in 2014.

**Scenario:**
Elon is the CEO of a large car manufacturer in Palo Alto, CA. While sleeping overnight at the factory one night, Elon realizes that he is bored to tears. He decides to break out his RHEL laptop to brush up on his **grep** skills. A friend recently emailed him a list containing a few dozen companies. He noticed that the list included the name of each company's CEO, and the date on which they assumed the CEO position. Elon wants to identify all of the CEOs who started in their position in 2014.

The file, **00_tech_companies2_unsorted.txt**, is in Elon's home directory.

What **grep** command is he going to use?
