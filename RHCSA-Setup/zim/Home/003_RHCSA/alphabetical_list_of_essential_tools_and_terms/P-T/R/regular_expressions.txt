**KYWRD:** regex
**RHCSA Objective: **001c Use grep and regular expressions to analyze text

**Summary:**
A **regular expression** is also known as a **regex** or **regexp**.  A regular expression is defined as a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.  This search pattern is then used by a string search algorithm to perform one of three possible tasks on a text string:
* find
* find and replace
* input validation

The concept of a regular expression was originally developed by American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene during the 1950s.  Regular expressions are used widely by: 
* search engines (e.g. Google, Yahoo, Baidu, Mojeek, and Bing)
* word processors and text editors (e.g. LibreOffice Writer, Microsoft Word, AbiWord, gedit, Notepad++, and Corel WordPerfect)
* text processing utilities (e.g. sed, awk, and grep)
* computer programming languages (e.g. C, C++, Perl, Java, Bash shell scripting etc.)
