**Summary**
In the first 3 tar-compress examples, we did not use Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools:B:bzip2 compression. In example 4, we will use the -j flag on the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:001 - left branches:Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2:tar command to ensure that the file is compressed using bzip2.

Tasks (NOTE: in examples, terminal commands are __highlighted__):
* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/tar/tar-compress_ex004]]
* Create a new file called myfile using the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch command.
* Verbosely compress myfile to myfile.tbz using the appropriate Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:001 - left branches:Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2:tar command.
