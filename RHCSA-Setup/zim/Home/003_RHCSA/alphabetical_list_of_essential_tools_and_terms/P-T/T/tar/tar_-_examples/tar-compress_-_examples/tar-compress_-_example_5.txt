**Summary**
--exclude=[file pattern] or [directory location]:  excludes files or directories based on a given file pattern or directory location

In example 5, we will create several files, and try to include them in a tar archive.  We will exclude a file that matches a certain pattern.

Tasks (NOTE: in examples, terminal commands are __highlighted__):
* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/tar/tar-compress_ex005]]
* Create the following files using the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch command:
	* myfile1.mp3
	* myfile2.mp3
	* myfile3.mp3
	* myfile4.mp4
* Change directory (Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools:C:cd) to go up one level
* Compress tar-compress_ex005 to an archive called tar-compress_ex005.tar.gz, but exclude myfile4.mp4
* Note that only myfile1.mp3, myfile2.mp3, and myfile3.mp3 were added to the archive
