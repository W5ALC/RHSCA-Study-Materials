**Summary**
In the previous two examples, we used tar -czvf.  The -z option tells tar to compress the archive using gzip. In example 3,
we will omit the -z flag so that the output is a tar archive without gzip compression. We will compress a single directory into a tar file using the following flags:
* -c: creates an archive.
* ~~-z: compress the archive using gzip.~~
* -v: verbose => diplay progress during the archiving process.
* -f: enable specifying the filename of the archive.

tar syntax - compressing a multiple files or directories into a single archive:  
* tar -cvf name-ofarchive.tar.gz /path/to/file-or-directory

Tasks (NOTE: in examples, terminal commands are __highlighted__):
* Navigate to the [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/tar/tar-compress_ex003|tar-compress_ex003]] folder in the examples/tar folder.
* Create a directory called mydir using the Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:K-O:M:mkdir command.
* Create 3 files inside of mydir called myfile1, myfile2, and myfile 3 using the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch command.
* Compress the mydir directory to a file called mydir.tar using the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:001 - left branches:Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2:tar command.
