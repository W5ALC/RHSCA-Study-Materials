Regular expressions can be very helpful in shortening commands.  A regular expression is a string of text that indicates a pattern.  You can create multiple Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch files by typing out the name of each empty file to be created:
* touch myfile 1 myfile2 myfile3 myfile4 myfile5

What if I had to create 10,000 files with a similar name? There must be a more concise way of creating a large number of files with a similar name. This is where regular expressions come in. In example 003, we are going to create ten files with very similar names with a very short touch command.

Tasks
* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/touch/touch_ex003]]
* Create ten empty files (myfile1 - myfile10) using the shortest possible touch command.
* Use Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls to view the newly created files.
