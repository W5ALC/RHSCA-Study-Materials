====== touch - example 005 ======
Created Sunday 15 July 2018

[[touch -a deep dive]]
[[T]]

In touch - example 005, we will see how the touch -a command can be used to change the access time and change time of files and folers to the current time

While Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch allows you to modify the three file/folder times below, Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:stat lets you view them:
1. access time
2. modify time
3. change time

Tasks
* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/touch/touch_ex005]]
* Create a new folder called myfolder using the Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:K-O:M:mkdir command.
* Use Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:stat to view the access time, modify time, and change time of myfolder.
* Use touch -a to change the times associated with myfolder.
* View the myfolder times again with stat.
* Note that the modify time has stayed the same, while the access time and change time have both been updated to the time when touch -a was run.

Now let's see if this works the same for a file.
* In the same directory (touch_ex005), create a new file called myfile using the touch command.
* View access, modify and change time for myfile using stat.
* Update myfile using touch -a.
* View access, modify and change time for myfile using stat.
* Note again that modify time has stayed the same while access time and change time have been updated to the time when touch -a was run.
