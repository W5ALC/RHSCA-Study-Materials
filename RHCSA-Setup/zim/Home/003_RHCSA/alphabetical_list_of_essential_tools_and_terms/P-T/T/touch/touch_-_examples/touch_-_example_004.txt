The Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch utility can more easily create multiple files using Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:R:regular expressions.  Instead of typing out multiple file names by hand, the user can instead give the touch command a regular expression to evaluate when creating the files.  A regular expression is basically just a pattern for the command to follow.

How can we use regular expressions to creat shorter commands? Consider the task of creating five files with a similar name:
* department_1
* department_2
* department_3
* department_4
* department_5

This is the long way of creating them:
* touch department_1 department_2 department_3 department_4 department_5

This is the much shorter way of creating them:
* touch department_ {1,2,3,4,5}

Tasks
* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/touch/touch_ex004]]
* Create department_1 to department_5 using the long command.
* View the newly created files using Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls.
* Delete the five files using this command: Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:rm -r department*
* Verify that all five files were deleted using Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls.
* Re-create the files using the shorter command.
* View the newly created files using Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls.
* Now create your own tasks to practice.
