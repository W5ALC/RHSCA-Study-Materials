	* dept_training_admins.txt

	* dept_security_officers.txt
	* dept_hardware_agents.html
* List all of the file in your current working directory using Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls to ensure that all 5 files were correctly created.
* Your boss wants a text file report to show her superiors proving that all 5 files were created.  Create a file named report.txt in the same directory with this proof.
