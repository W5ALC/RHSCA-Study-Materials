[[T]]

The touch -t flag allows you to explicity set the timestamp on a file .  The systax for this is as follows:
* touch -t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]
	* CC is the first 2 digits of the year
	* YY is the last two digits of the year
		* If YY is in the range 70-99, then CC is assumed to equal 19. 
		* If YY is in the range 00-37, then CC is assumed to equal 20.
		* Date cannot currently be set beyond January 18, 2038.
	* MM is the month
	* DD is the date
	* hh is the hour (24 hour format, e.g. 5 PM would be 17)
	* mm is the minute
	* ss is the second

In example 2, we will create a new file, view its timestamp information, and then change the timestamp to a different time.

Tasks
* We have already learned how to create a new empty file using Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch in [[touch:touch - examples:touch - example 001]] .
* We will navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/touch/touch_ex002]]
* We will create a new empty file called timestamp_example.txt
* We will view the new file's timestamp using the Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:stat command.
* We will change the timestamp to June 19, 1997 5:47 PM and 23 seconds.
* View the file again with stat to verify that the timestamp has been updated.
