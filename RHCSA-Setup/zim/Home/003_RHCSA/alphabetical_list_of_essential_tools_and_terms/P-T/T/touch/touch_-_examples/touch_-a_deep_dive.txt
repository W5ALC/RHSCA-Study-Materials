touch -a deep dive
The Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch -a sets the access time and change time of a file or directory.  __Touch -a does NOT change the modify time.__  To change the modify time, the -m option must be invoked.

If the file does not currently exist, then the touch -a command will create it.  Two commands can be used closely together to see/modify time stats of a file or folder: Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch and Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:stat.

While touch -a allows you to modify the access time and change time below, stat lets you view all three of them:
1. access time
2. modify time
3. change time

In [[touch - examples:touch - example 005]], we will see touch - a in use.
