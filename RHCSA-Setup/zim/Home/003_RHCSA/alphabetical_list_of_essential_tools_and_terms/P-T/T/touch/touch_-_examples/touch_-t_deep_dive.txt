[[touch:touch - description]]
[[T]]

The touch -t flag allows you to explicity set the timestamp on a file .  The systax for this is as follows:
* touch -t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]
	* CC is the first 2 digits of the year
	* YY is the last two digits of the year
		* If YY is in the range 70-99, then CC is assumed to equal 19. 
		* If YY is in the range 00-37, then CC is assumed to equal 20.
		* Date cannot currently be set beyond January 18, 2038.
	* MM is the month
	* DD is the date
	* hh is the hour 
	* mm is the minute
	* ss is the second

So let us put all of this information to use in [[touch:touch - examples:touch - example 002]] .  We will copy all of the information above to the example file to make life a little bit easier.
