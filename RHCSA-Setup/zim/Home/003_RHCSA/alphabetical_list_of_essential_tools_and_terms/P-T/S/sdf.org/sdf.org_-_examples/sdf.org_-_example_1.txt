**KYWRD:** sdf.org - example 1
**RHCSA Objective: **Type the target RHCSA Objective here.

**Summary**
Connect to an sdf.org remote shell using a CentOS VM.

**Scenario**
Kayode is a RHEL sysadmin at Linux Academy. He wants test ssh on his RHEL system using sdf.org's remote Unix shells.

**Note:**
I signed up for a free sdf.org account to do this tutorial. The account works fine, and I can login to it via ssh, and I can create new files using the [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:T:touch|touch]] command. However, I cannot edit the new file using [[Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:K-O:N:nano|nano]] for some reason (I get an error message saying that the file cannot be saved).  After doing some research, I found that sdf.org has a European sister site: https://sdfeu.org/w/ I signed up for a free account at **sdfeu.org**, and everything works! I can login to the remote server via ssh, and I can create AND edit files. So I will use the sdfeu account for all future remote-shell-related examples. If you choose to sign up, I recommend  https://sdfeu.org/w/ .

**sdf.org - example 1 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
1. Startup your CentOS/RHEL system, and login as a normal user.
2. **Steps 3-8 are optional.** //If you don't feel comfortable creating an sdf.org account, //**don't**//. You can just learn from the tutorial below.//
3. Create a free Unix shell account at https://sdf.org/
4. Open a terminal on your CentOS/RHEL machine and connect to your sdf server using ssh:
	a. __ssh your_username@tty.sdf.org__
5. Create a new empty file called **test_file.txt** :
	a. __touch for_example1.txt__
6. View the new file:
	a. __ls__
7. Remove **test_file.txt** :
	a. __rm text_file.txt__
8. Exit the sdf terminal:
	a. __exit__
