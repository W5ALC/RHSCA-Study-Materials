**Summary**
The primary function of the Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:stat utility is to return files attributes of a given Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:F-J:I:inode. In example 1, we will run stat to see the attributes of a simple text file.

In previous examples, we have used the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch command to create empty files. In this example, we will try something a little bit different: we will create a new file with content using the Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:A-E:E:echo command.

Tasks
* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/stat/stat_ex001]]
* Note: in this example I used wildcards to my advantage.  Instead of typing out the entire name of departmental_report.txt, I used a wildcard shortcut: d*
* Creat a new file called departmental_report.txt with the echo command:
	* The content of the file will be: Departmental Report - July 8th, 2027
* View the contents of the new file using the Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools:C:cat command.
* View the status of departmental_report.txt using Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:stat.
