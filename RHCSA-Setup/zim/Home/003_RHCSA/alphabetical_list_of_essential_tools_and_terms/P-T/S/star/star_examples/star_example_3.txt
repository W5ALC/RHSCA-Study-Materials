**Summary**
In star example 3, we will create a new directory, and add 60 new files to it.  We will then compress those 60 files into a tarfile, delete the 60 input files, and then extract the 60 files from the archive.

 Let us look at the general format of the commands we will use:
* create new directory: Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:K-O:M:mkdir new_directory_name
* add 60 new files to directory: Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch new_file_name{01..60}
* compress the 60 files into a new tarfile named new_tarfile.tar: 
	* star -cv -f=new_tarfile.tar new_file_name{01..60}
	* OR
	* star -cv -file=tarfile.tar new_file_name{01..60}
* delete the 60 input files: rm new_file_name{00..60}
* extract the 60 files from the archive: star -xv f=new_tarfile.tar

Let's do it.

Tasks (NOTE: in examples, terminal commands are __highlighted__):
* **PART 1**
	* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/star/star-compress_ex003]]
	* Use Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:K-O:M:mkdir to create two new directories called red_hat_servers01 and red_hat_servers02
	* Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools:C:cd into red_hat_servers01
	* Using Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch, create 60 new Kubernetes config files: kubernetes_config{01..60}.yaml
	* Using Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:001 - left branches:Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2:star, compress the 60 files into a tarfile named kubernetes_archive_07192021.tar (in this instance we will use the -f flag vice the -file flag, but keep in mind that they are equivalent).
* **PART 2**
	* Delete the 60 input files using Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:rm.
	* Extract the 60 files frm the archive using the star command.
* **PART 3** 
	* List all of the files in the directory using Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls

Now, in the second directory, red_hat_servers02, we will just verify that the -file option does what we expect it to.
* Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools:C:cd into red_hat_servers02 ( cd [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/star/star-compress_ex003/red_hat_servers02]])
* Create 25 files: training_doc.001.odt to training_doc025.odt
* Add the 25 docs to an archive named training_doc.tar (this time we will use the -file option)
* Use Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls to verify that all of the correct documents were created.
