**Summary**
In Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:001 - left branches:Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2:star example 1, we will compress several files into an archive using the star -c command. Let us review what the -c option does for a given star command:

star-options
* -c
	* creates a new tarfile and writes named files to it
	* writing starts at the beginning of the tarfile
	* verbosity can be increased by adding the -v (verbose) option

Tasks (NOTE: in examples, terminal commands are __highlighted__):
* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/star/star-compress_ex001]]
	* __cd ~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/star/star-compress_ex001__
* Create 5 new files using the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch command (we've learned the shortened Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:touch command using regular expressions, so we'll use that):
	* __touch star_file{1..5}__
		* star_file1
		* star_file2
		* star_file3
		* star_file4
		* star_file5
* Use the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls command to verify that the files were correctly created: __ls__
* Use the Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:001 - left branches:Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2:star -c command to create a new tar archive named star_files.tar containing all 5 files 
	* to create a shorter command, we will use a regular expression instead of typing all of the file names out by hand.
	* Since we want to name the tarfile, we have to add the -f option. The syntax for this is -f=tarfile_name. 
	* For example: star -c -f=tarfile_name.tar files{1..5}
	* Our command: __star -c -f=star_files.tar star_file(1..5}__
* Use ls to verify that the .tar archive was correctly created: __ls__
