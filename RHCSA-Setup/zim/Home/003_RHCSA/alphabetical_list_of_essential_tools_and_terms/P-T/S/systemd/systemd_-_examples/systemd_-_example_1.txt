**Summary**
In systemd - example 1, we will use systemd's systemctl utility to enable the Apache Web Server (httpd). We will then copy a simple web page to the appropriate Apache directory, and view the web page using a web browser. We will then disable httpd, and delete the web page from the Apache directory.

Tasks
* Navigate to [[~/Sync/PROJECTS/RHCSA/examples/systemd/systemd_ex001]]
* Run Home:RHCSA:exam:objectives:001 - understand and use essential tools:files:ls
* You will notice our simple example web page: systemd_ex001.html
* Start the Apache Web Server (httpd) with the Home:RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:systemctl command: 
	* systemctl start httpd.service (you will be prompted for the admin password => enter it)
* Verify httpd is running: systemctl status httpd (hit "q" to quit after you have observed "active (running)" as httpd's status)
* Copy systemd_ex001.html to [[/var/www/html]] (this will require admin privileges, so we will use su -c):
	* su -c "cp systemd_ex001.html [[/var/www/html"]]
	* Enter you admin password
* Open the web browser of your choice and go to this page: localhost/systemd_ex001.html
* You should see the web page below:

* Disable httpd: 
	* systemctl stop httpd.service (when prompted, enter your admin password)
* Verify httpd is no longer running by refreshing your web browser at localhost/systemd_ex001.html
* The web page should no longer be viewable.
* Delete systemd_ex001.html from [[/var/www/html:]] su -c "rm [[/var/www/html/]]systemd_ex001.html"
* Verify that systemd_ex001.html is deleted: cd [[/var/www/html]];ls
* This completes systemd example 1. A summary of everything that we did can be seen in the image below. (Note: I had a small typo when I first tried to delete systemd_example001.html, but I quickly recovered).
