**ports (portnumber_abbreviation_TCPorUDP : full_name : short_description.):**
* [[+00001 TCPMUX TCP]] : TCP Port Service Multiplexer : TCP port multiplexing service.
* [[+00007 Echo Protocol TCP+UDP]] : Echo Protocol : Testing and measurement.
* [[+00009 Discard Protocol TCP+UDP]] : Discard Protocol : Is a null service used for testing and debugging.
* [[+00011 Systat TCP+UDP]] : Active Users : Used for debugging and measurement.
* [[+00013 Daytime Protocol TCP+UDP]] : Daytime Protocol : Sends date and time for testing and measurement purposes.
* [[+00017 QOTD TCP+UDP]] : Quote of the Day : Serves up daily quotes to connected hosts; also used for testing and measurement.
* [[+00018 MSP TCP+UDP]] : Message Send Protocol : Is used to send short messages between network nodes.
