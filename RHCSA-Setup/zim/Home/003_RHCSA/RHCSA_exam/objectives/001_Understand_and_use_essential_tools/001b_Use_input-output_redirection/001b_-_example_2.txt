**KYWRD:** 001b - example 2
**RHCSA Objective: **001b Use input-output redirection

**Summary**
Get a list of all mounted filesystems, and send it to a file named mounted_filesystems_jan2029.txt.

**Scenario**
Benedict is on a break from shooting Into Darkness. He slides into his trailer, and starts up his CentOS laptop. Linux is his secret passion, and he plans on becoming a certified RHCE once he retires from acting. Benedict can't quite remember the command to list all mounted filesystems.  He wants to list the first 10 lines of /proc/mounts, and send it to a new file called mounted_filesystems_jan2029.txt. **What do you tell him to do?**

**001b - example 2 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
1. Startup your CentOS/RHEL system, and login as a normal user.
2. What directory lists all mounted filesystems? **/proc/mounts**
3. To get the first 10 lines of a file, we use the head command. We will pipe the result of cat [[/proc/mounts]] to head with the | operator.
4. So how will we built a command that lists the first 10 lines of /proc/mounts: __cat  /proc/mounts | head__
5. Building the entire command, how do we send the output of __cat /proc/mounts | head__ to a file:
	a. __cat /proc/mounts | head > mounted_filesystems_jan2029.txt__
6. Verify that the .txt file was created with the ls command: __ls__
	a. look for mounted_filesystems_jan2029.txt
7. Look at the contents of mounted_filesystems_jan2029.txt with the cat command:
	a. __cat mounted_filesystems_jan2029.txt__
