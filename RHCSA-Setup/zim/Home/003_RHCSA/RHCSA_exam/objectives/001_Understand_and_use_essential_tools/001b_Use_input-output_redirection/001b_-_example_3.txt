**KYWRD:** 001b - example 3
**RHCSA Objective: **__001b Use input-output redirection__

**Summary**
Create an unsorted list of tech companies, sort the companies alphabetically, and create a file that contains the sorted output.  We will use the **<** operator to redirect the standard input (stdin) from the keyboard to a file named tech_companies_unsorted.txt. We will use the **>** operator to redirect the output from our screen to a file named tech_companies_sorted.txt.

**Scenario**
Diallo is a RHEL sysdadmin at Google. He has been tasked with sorting a large list of companies alphabetically. He has to email the sorted list to his boss by 3 PM. The unsorted list is in a file called tech_companies_unsorted.txt.  Diallo has to send his boss tech_companies_sorted.txt. How is he going to do it?

**001b - example 3 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
1. Startup your CentOS/RHEL system, and login as a normal user.
2. Redirect tech_companies_unsorted.txt on Github to tech_companies_unsorted.txt in your home directory:
	a. __curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RexDjere/RHCSA/master/examples/001b/001b%20-%20example%203/tech_companies_unsorted.txt > tech_companies_unsorted.txt__
3. View the unsorted list: __cat tech_companies_unsorted.txt__
4. Sort the companies, and save the sorted file as tech_companies_sorted.txt:
	a. __sort < tech_companies_unsorted.txt > tech_companies_sorted.txt__
5. View the contents of the sorted file: __cat tech_companies_sorted.txt__
