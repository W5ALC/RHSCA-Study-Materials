**KYWRD:** metacharacter
**RHCSA Objective: **001b Use input-output redirection

**Summary:**
**Redirection** is used to redirect the **input (stdin)**, **output (stdout)**, or **error (stderr)** data of a process within a Linux/Unix shell.  **metacharacters** are interpreted by the shell instead of being passed on to the comand issued by the shell's user. There are several metacharacters used for redirection:
* **Metacharacter; Function; Notes:**
	* > ; output redirection; overwrites any existing data in the output file
	* >> ; output redirection; appends new data to the end of existing file, if it exists
	* < ; input redirection; usually involves a file being redirected to the standard input of a process
	* << //stream_marker// ; in-line input redirection; input character stream is listed as part of the command line
	* 2> ; error redirection; overwrites any existing data in the output file
	* 2>> ; error redirection; appends new data to the end of existing file, if it exists

There are also other metacharacters:
* **Metacharacter; Function:**
	* *; wildcard for file substitution of zero or more characters
	* ?; wildcard for file substitution of one character
	* [ ]; any character between the brackets is a file substitution wildcard
	* `cmd` ; command substitution
	* $(cmd) ; command substitution
	* | ; pipe, redirects the data from the output of one process to the input of another process
	* ;  - semi-colon separates a sequence of commands
	* || ; logical OR for conditional process execution
	* && ; logical	AND for conditional process execution
	* ( ) ; used to group commands to form a sequence of commands
	* & ; tells shell to run command within a background process
	* # 	; tells shell to ignore a string of text. This string forms a comment: text that provides information to code viewer, but is not processed by the shell
	* $ ; tells shell to expand the value of a variable
	* \  ;  tells shell to prevent or escape interpretation of the next character
