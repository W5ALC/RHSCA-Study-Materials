001d Access remote systems using SSH

**KYWRD:** 001d - example 1
**RHCSA Objective: **001d Access remote systems using SSH

**Summary**
Use SSH command to login to a remote server, create a set of new empty files, delete the new files, and then exit the SSH session.

**Scenario**
Paul (**your_username@tty.sdf.org**) wants to:
1. login to the remote sdf.org server using SSH.
2. create a new directory called **my_files**.
3. create an empty file in **my_files** called **my_doc1.odt**.
4. List **my_doc1.odt** to make sure that it was created.
5. cleanup by deleting all created files (//sdf.org does not allow the -r flag//).
6. List contents of home directory to ensure that **my_files** was deleted.
7. Exit sdf.org Unix shell.
