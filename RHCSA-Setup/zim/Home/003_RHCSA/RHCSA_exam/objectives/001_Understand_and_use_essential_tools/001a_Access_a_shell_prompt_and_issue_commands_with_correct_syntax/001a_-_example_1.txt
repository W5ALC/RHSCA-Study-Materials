**KYWRD:** 001a - example 1
**RHCSA Objective: **001a Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax

**Summary**
In 001a - example 1, we are using the terminal in multi-user.target (formerly known as runlevel 3) on a CentOS virtual machine. This example assumes that you already have networking enabled on the CentOS machine, including Internet access. We will complete the following tasks:
* login
* update the system using yum
* install the Gnome Desktop Environment
* use systemctl start to start Gnome
* use gnome-terminal within the Gnome environment
	* change the system hostname
	* go back to multi-user.target using a command in gnome-terminal


**001a - example 1 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
* Startup your CentOS machine, and login using your username and password **(Figure 1)**
* Update the CentOS system using yum **(Figure 2)**. Running yum requires admin privileges (hence su -c, or sudo if sudo is enabled for your account): __su -c "yum update"__
* Install Gnome Graphical User Environment from the Internet (in a later example, we will walk through using a local repository).
	* Note that the command for installing the Gnome Graphical Enviroment differs between CentOS and RHEL:
		* CentOS command: __su -c ' yum groupinstall "Gnome Dekstop" "Graphical Administration Tools" '__ (**Note:** the extra space before the closing " ' " is not needed. I just added the space to make it easier to see the construction of the command). **(Figure 3)**
	* RHEL command: __su -c "groupinstall "Server with GUI""__ 
* Now, we will use this systemctl command to shift to graphical.target (equivalent to the old runlevel 5). This command must be run with root privileges, hence su -c: __su -c "systemctl isolate graphical.target"__ **(Figure 4)**
* Use gnome-terminal from within the Gnome environment **(Figure 5)**
	* the hostname for the VM is still "localhost". Let's change the hostname to something more descriptive like centos.desktop1: 
		* __hostnamectl set-hostname centos.desktop1__  (**Note:** I will be asked to enter the root password by a popup window if I use this version of the command).
		* OR
		* __su -c "hostnamectl set-hostname centos.desktop1"__ 
	* After the change, we will display the hostname using this command: __hostnamectl__
* Finally, we will go back to the commandline environment of multi-user.target: __su -c "systemctl isolate multi-user.target"__ **(Figure 6)**
