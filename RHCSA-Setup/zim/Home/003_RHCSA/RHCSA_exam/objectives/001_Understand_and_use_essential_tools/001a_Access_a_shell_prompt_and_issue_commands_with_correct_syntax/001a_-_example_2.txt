**KYWRD:** 001a - example 2
**RHCSA Objective: **001a Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax

**Summary**
Open a terminal on a CentOS/RHEL system, create a new directory and several sub-directories, convert several man pages to html, and store them in the new sub-directories.

**001a -example 2 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
* **Task 1:** Startup your Centos/RHEL system, and login as a normal user.
* **Task 2:** In your home directory, create a new directory called man_pages that has the following sub-directories:
	* alias
	* bzip2
	* cat
	* mv
* **Note:** in Task 2, we are going to use mkdir with the -p option. mkdir -p allows you to create a directory with subdirectories. You can pass several arguments to the mkdir command, so our command will look like this:  __mkdir -p man_pages/alias man_pages/bzip2 man_pages/cat man_pages/mv__
* **Note**: here is a much shorter command that accomplishes the same goal as the command above: mkdir -p man_pages/{alias,bzip2,cat,mv}
* **Task 3:** verify that all 4 sub-directories were correctly created:
	* change directory to man_pages: __cd man-pages__
	* list the contents of man_pages: __ls__
* **Task 4:** Move back up to your home directory (__cd ..__ move you up one level in the filesystem structure): __cd ..__
* **Task 5:** Use the ls command to verify that you are back in your home directory, and that the **man_pages** directory exists (NOTE: you could have also used the __cd ~__ command to move back to your home directory. Note that your terminal prompt should currently say **[your_username@your_hostname ~]$**): __ls__
* **Task 6: **Use the man -Thtml command to create the 4 required man pages in html format (the man -Thtml command can accept multiple arguments): 
	* __man -Thtml alias > man_pages/alias/alias.html bzip2 > man_pages/bzip2/bzip2.html cat > man_pages/cat/cman -Thtmlat.html mv > man_pages/mv/mv.html__
* **Task 7: **Verify that all of the new files are in the correct location using the find command: 
	* __find man_pages__
	* inspect the output of the find command above to verify that all 4 html files are in their correct locations.
* **Task 8: **Please review Tasks 1-8 on your screen, and compare it to Figure 1 below.
