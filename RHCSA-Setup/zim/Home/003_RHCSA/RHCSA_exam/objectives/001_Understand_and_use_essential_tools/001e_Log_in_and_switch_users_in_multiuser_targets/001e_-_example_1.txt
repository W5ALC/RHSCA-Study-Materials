001e Log in and switch users in multiuser targets

**KYWRD:** 001e - example 1
**RHCSA Objective: **001e Log in and switch users in multiuser targets

**Summary:**
Add a new user, switch to the new user's account, and the delete the new user.

**Scenario:**
Kwamé Holland is a RHEL sysadmin student at Linux Academy. He wants to complete the following tasks:
1. Create a new account for himself on the RHEL system with a home directory:
	* **username:** kwame_holland1
	* **password**: 123456
2. Create a second new account for himself:
	* **username:** kwame_holland2
	* **password**: 765432
3. Switch between the accounts using **su - **.
4. Delete both of Kwamé Holland's accounts recursively (delete account, home directory and mail spool).
5. Verify that both accounts are deleted.

**001e - example 1 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
- Startup your CentOS/RHEL system, and login as a normal user.
1. Create new account for Kwamé Holland with a home directory:
	a. __su -c "useradd -m kwame_holland1"__
	b. __su -c "passwd kwame_holland1"__
2. Create second new account for Kwamé:
	a. __su -c "useradd -m kwame_holland2"__
	b. __su -c "passwd kwame_holland2"__
3. Switch between accounts using **su - **:
	a. Switch to kwame_holland1: __su - kwame_holland1__
	b. Switch to kwame_holland2: __su - kwame_holland2__
	c. Switch back to original account: __su - original_username__
4. Delete both of Kwamé Holland accounts recursively (delete account, home directory and mail spool):
	a. **NOTE 1:** since we switched to both accounts, they are both still involved with processes, so we will have to invoke the **--force** option to force the user delete.
	b. **NOTE 2:** even using the **--force** option, we will still get an error message say that the accounts are using a process, but they will still be deleted.
	c. __su -c "userdel --force -r kwame_holland1"__
	d. __su -c "userdel --force -r kwame_holland2"__
5. Verify that both accounts are deleted:
	a. First verify that the original user's home directory still exits: ls [[/home]] | grep "original_username"
	b. Now try the same with kwame_holland1:  __ls /home | grep kwame_holland1__
	c. Try the same with kwame_holland2:  __ls /home | grep kwame_holland2__
	d. Since we know that the original user's account still exists, we will look for the original user: __cat /etc/passwd | grep original_user*__
	e. Now, look for Kwame Holland in the [[/etc/passwd]] file:
		1. __cat /etc/passwd | grep kwame*__
	f. Both of Kwamé Holland's accounts have been verified deleted.
