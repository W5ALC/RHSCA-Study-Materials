**KYWRD:** 001c - example 1
**RHCSA Objective: **001c Use grep and regular expressions to analyze text

**Summary**
Use grep to search a text file for a string.

**Notes**
The url for this example is extremely long, so I used the bit.ly url shortener. The shortened url is here: https://bit.ly/2P7QEAp
The syntax for using curl to download shortened urls is as follows:
* curl -L -o newname.txt http://your.shortened.url

**Scenario**
Chris has received a new assignment from his boss Crystal:
* Crystal is going on a business trip to Taiwan, and she wants to search **00_tech_companies_unsorted.txt** for companies in Taiwan.
* She wants Chris to sort **00_tech_companies_unsorted.txt** by company name,  and create **01_tech_companies_sorted.txt**. 
* She wants Chris to email her **02_taiwan_tech_companies.txt**, a list of only the Taiwan-based companies.

**001c - example 1 - tasks **(command line commands are __highlighted__)**:**
1. Startup your CentOS/RHEL system, and login as a normal user.
2. Download **00_tech_companies_unsorted.txt**: 
	a. __curl -L -o 00_tech_companies_unsorted.txt https://bit.ly/2P7QEAp__
	b. Verify that the file was correctly downloaded: __head 00*__
3. Sort the downloaded file: __sort 00* > 01_tech_companies_sorted.txt__
4. Verify that the file was corrrectly sorted: __head 01*__
5. Use **grep** to find Taiwan companies and save to new file: __grep "Taiwan" 01* > 02_taiwan_tech_companies.txt__
6. View the Taiwan companies file: __cat 02*__
