**RHCSA Objective: **001d Access remote systems using ssh

**Summary**
SSH stands for **Secure Shell**. SSH is a command-line interface and protocol that is used to access remote Linux/Unix computers from a Linux/Unix machine. SSH is part of a 3-part suite of secure applications:
1. slogin [[:Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:slogin]]
2. SSH [[:Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:P:ports:00022 SSH TCP]]
3. scp [[:Home:003 RHCSA:alphabetical list of essential tools and terms:P-T:S:scp]]

**remote SSH - examples:**
* [[+001d - example 1]] : Transfer a file to a RHEL/CentOS machine using scp, Login to the remote machine via ssh, and manipulate the newly transferred file via the ssh connection.
* [[+001d - example 2]] : Login to a RHEL/CentOS machine via ssh, transfer a file to it using scp, and manipulate the newly transferred file via the ssh connection.
* [[+001d - example 3]] : briefly describe example 3.
