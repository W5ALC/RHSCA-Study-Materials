**KYWRD:** binary location

**Summary** (terminal commands are __highlighted__)
The location of executable files in Linux be determined using the whereis command with the -b option. For example, to find the location of the gzip executable, we would run this command:
* whereis -b gzip
* NOTE: the which command can also be used to list the location of a binary, but it can produce a different location than whereis -b:
	* which gzip

**The output of whereis -b gzip:**
* gzip: /usr/bin/gzip

**The output of which gzip:**
* /bin/gzip
