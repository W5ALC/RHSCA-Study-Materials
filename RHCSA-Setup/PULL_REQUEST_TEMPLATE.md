## Purpose
- A pull request (PR) is an effective way to get new features added to this RHCSA Study Guide, or to fix existing problems.
- Make the description section of your PR as clear, concise, and descriptive as possible.

## Questions to think about before submitting a new PR
- Getting new features added: will this new feature make the study guide easier or harder to use? (Strive for easier).
- Fixing problems: Does this proposed change effectively fix the problem(s) that it is designed to fix? (only submit the PR if YES).
- Fixing problems: If the answer to the question above is "YES", does the proposed change also add problems? (Shoot for NO).

#### Open Questions and Pre-Merge TODOs
- [ ] GitHub checklists are your friend. Use them.  When you've solved a problem, check the box, and explain the answer.

## Research and Learning
- Take notes as you research, and clearly describe the path that you took to come to a solution or improvement idea.  This will make the PR much easier to review.
- Provide links to resources that you used to solve the problem or come up with the improvement idea: articles, blog posts, other study guides, etc.
